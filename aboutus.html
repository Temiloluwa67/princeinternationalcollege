          <p>Prince International School is founded by Pastor and Pastor Dr (Mrs) Olaposi in the year 2001. The school resumed in September of the same year of establishment. The school opened with few numbers of pupils and from then, it keeps increasing terminally. The secondary school was instigated in September, 2011.</p><br> 
          <p>PIS is indeed efficacious in educating and indefatigable in inculcating moral values in right cadence and as well endeavour to insure all by God’s grace the success of its pupils and students. Since its first set of students, it has gained a reputation for academic excellence.</p><br>
